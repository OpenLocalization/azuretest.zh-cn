#Microsoft Azure preview portal overview

The Microsoft Azure preview portal is a central place where you can provision and manage your Azure resources.
This tutorial will familiarize you with the portal and show you how to use some of these key capabilities:

*   A **comprehensive marketplace** that lets you browse through thousands of items from Microsoft and other vendors that can be purchased and/or provisioned.
*   A **unified and scalable browse experience** that makes it easy to find the resources you care about and perform various management operations.
*   **Consistent management pages** (or blades) that let you manage Azure’s wide variety of services through a consistent way of exposing settings, actions, billing information, health monitoring and usage data, and much more.
*   A **personal experience** that lets you create a customized start screen that shows the information that you want to see whenever you log in.
    You can also customize any of the management blades that contain tiles.

How to create a resource
Azure has a marketplace with thousands of items that you can create from one place.
Let’s say you want to create a new Windows Server 2012 VM.

1.  The +NEW hub is your entry point into a curated set of featured categories from the marketplace.
2.  Each category has a small set of featured items along with a link to the full marketplace that shows all categories and search.
3.  To create that new Windows Server 2012 VM, perform the following actions:

Windows Server 2012 is featured, so you can select it from the Compute category.

![Portal Categories][portalcategories]

##Fill out some basic inputs on a form.

Click ‘Create’ and you’re VM will begin to provision immediately.
The notifications hub will alert you when your resource has been created and a management blade will open (you can always browse to resources later).

How to find your resources
You can always pin frequently accessed resources to your startboard, but you might need to browse to something that you don’t frequently access.[The browse hub shown below is your way to get to all of your resources.](role-based-access-control-configure.md)You can filter by subscription, choose/resize columns, and navigate to the management blades by clicking on individual items.
